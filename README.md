## Fancy Plots

I wrote these routines to make life a little bit easy and have publication ready plots using python without using any other fancy wrappers around as I like to keep my plotting routines simple and effective.

The main function I use is `fixPlot` which basically does everything for me. The way to use the function is 

```
fixPlot()               # Call fixPlot before you call plt.figure()
plt.figure(1) 
<Your plots go here>
plt.show()
```

If you have suggestions or recommendations, please reach out. Thanks!
